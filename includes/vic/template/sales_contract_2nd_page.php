<br/> 

<b>Some things you must do</b><br/>  
<span>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At all times so that we can do the works you must provide to us and our employees, agents or subcontractors: <br/>
	 	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> a clear site;<br/>
		<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> exclusive, free and uninterrupted access to all areas of the site where work is to be carried out; and<br/>
		<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> electrical power to all areas of the site where work is to be carried out.<br/> 

<br/> 
<span>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you do not, we may do the things necessary to get these things and charge you extra for that. 
<br/> 

<span>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You must not:<br/>
	  
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> a clear site;<br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> exclusive, free and uninterrupted access to all areas of the site where work is to be carried out; and<br/>
 

<br/> 
<span>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If we ask, you must show us the correct location of the site boundaries.  If there is doubt, you must pay for a surveyor to peg the site and the position of the work.<br/>
 

<br/> 
<span> 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You must tell us now of any easements or encumbrances.  You must tell us now anything else we should know about the site or its boundaries.  You are responsible for the correctness of everything you tell us.  (This includes any documents you provide to us.)<br/> 

<br/> 
<span>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You are responsible (and you must pay) for:<br/> 
	 
			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> storm water disposal;<br/>
			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> relocation of any services;<br/> 
			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> removal of rock;<br/>
			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> repairs to any underground services<br/>		
			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless it says otherwise in this contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br/>	
 

<br/> 
<span>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You must tell us now of any easements or encumbrances.  You must tell us now anything else we should know about the site or its boundaries.  You are responsible for the correctness of everything you tell us.  (This includes any documents you provide to us.)<br/>

<br/> 
<b>Materials</b> <br/>
<span> 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We own the materials used in connection with the works until you have paid all amounts due to us in full.<br/> 		 
<span> 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Until that time you only have possession of the materials as bailee for us.<br/> 
<span> 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Your right to possession of the materials ends if payment for the materials is due but is not paid.<br/> 	 
<span> 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In that case, we may enter any premises where the materials are, or are reasonably thought to be, and repossess them. <br/>  
<span> 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We may substitute different materials if the original materials are difficult or impossible to get.<br/> 	
<span> 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We own surplus materials supplied by us.<br/> 
<span> We will remove them from the site prior to practical completion. </span> <br/> 
 

<br/> 
<b>Payment</b> <br/> 
	<span>  16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> You must pay us the deposit and the rest of the price in the instalments, and at the stages of the works, specified above.<br/> 
	<span> 17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> You have 1 business day to pay us from when a claim is given to you.  If you do not pay in that time, you must pay us interest on any amount outstanding at a rate of one percent (1%) more than the then current rate charged by the National Australia Bank for overdrafts of $10,000 or more.  Also, in that case, you must pay all legal or other collection costs we incur to collect any amount you owe us.<br/> 
	<span> 18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When the works are practically complete we will give you a final account and you must then pay the final account in full (that is, with no set-off or reduction) by cash or bank cheque. Then we will hand over the works to you.<br/> 		 
	<span> 19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> You should give us a written notice of any defective or incomplete parts of the works about 3 months after practical completion.  Provided you have paid the final account (and any other accounts) in full, we will then fix them within a reasonable time.<br/> 	 	
 
<br/> 
<b>Approvals</b> <br/> 
<span>  20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If approval for the works is required from any statutory authority you and we must use our best efforts to obtain that approval.  If that approval is refused you must pay us all of our costs incurred up to the date of refusal plus 20% for our profit and overheads.  After that, we have no further claim against you and you have no claim against us.  <br/> 
 
	
<br/> 
<b>Timing</b> <br/> 
<span>  21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We will start doing the works as soon as reasonable after we receive approval for the works under clause 20.<br/> 	 
<span>  22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Where there is no specific start date on page 1, we will do everything that it is reasonably possible for us to do to ensure that the works will start as soon as possible and we must use reasonable effort to finish the works quickly subject to any delays caused by things that are beyond our control.<br/> 
  
<br/> 
<b>Variations</b> <br/> 
<span> 23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You and we must both agree to any variation, apart from those under Clause 4. <br/>		 
<span>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  Except for them, this Clause 23 applies.  <br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> torm water disposal;<br/>	
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> relocation of any services;<br/>			
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> removal of rock;<br/>	
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> repairs to any underground services<br/>				
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.5  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> storm water disposal;<br/>	
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.6  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> storm water disposal;<br/>	
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.7  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> relocation of any services;<br/>			
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.8  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> removal of rock;<br/>	
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.9  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> repairs to any underground services<br/>		

<br/><br/>   
<span> 24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If the engineer requires extra work we will tell you and we will charge extra for that work. <br/>
 

<br/> 
<b>Work or materials by you</b> <br/>  
<span>  25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This clause applies if you are supplying materials or doing any of the works.  In that case, you must do that work and/or supply those materials free of defects at the right time and, in any case, within 7 days of our request. <br/>
<span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not, we may supply the materials or do the work as a variation, and you will be charged the actual cost to us (excluding GST) to do that plus another 15% (which includes overheads).  GST will be added to the total. <br/>
 


<br/> 
<b>Our liability and insurance</b> <br/> 
<span> 26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We are not responsible for damage to existing structures or fittings.  We will however take reasonable care not to cause such damage when doing the works.<br/>	 
<span> 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We will insure the works until practical completion.  You are responsible for the works after practical completion.  You should get insurance from that time.<br/>		 			 	
<span> 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Vergola system is guaranteed against defects in materials or workmanship for five (5) years from the date of installation except that motors and controllers are guaranteed against defects in materials and workmanship for two (2) years from the date of installation.<br/>
<span> 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We will obtain the required insurance under the Building Act 1993.<br/>		 			 	
 
<br/> 
<b>Breaches, stopping work and termination</b> <br/> 
<span> 30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We may stop the works by written notice if you breach (disobey) this contract.<br/>
<span> 31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If Clause 33 allows it, we can still terminate this contract because of the breach.  Stopping the works does not affect this right.<br/>			 	
<span> 32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If you correct the breach before we terminate, we will re-start the works within a reasonable time.<br/> 	 
<span> 33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We may terminate this contract by written notice if:<br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> you fail to make any payment due <br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> you take possession of the work without our consent <br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> you disobey Clause 5 or <br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> there is any other substantial breach of this contract by you. <br/>			
	 
<span>34.   </span>If we do that, we may remove any unfixed materials from the site.<br/>		 	
<span>35.   </span> You may terminate this contract by written notice if there is a substantial breach of this contract by us.<br/>		 
<span>36.   </span> Termination does not affect rights rising from a breach of contract.<br/>	 
<span>37.   </span> Either you, or we, may terminate this contract by written notice if the other -<br/>	 
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> commits a substantial breach of this contract; or <br/>
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> does an act of bankruptcy (see the Bankruptcy Act); or 	<br/>	
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> comes under external administration, if a company (see the Corporations Law).
																							However, you cannot terminate this contract when you are in substantial breach of it.
																							Subject to that if the contract is terminated by you (except under clause 35) you must pay us either:<br/>
																							 
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> all of our costs incurred up to the date of termination plus our profit; or<<br/>		
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.5  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> 20% of the price whichever is the greater.<br/>		
	<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, we have no further claim against you and you have no claim against us<br/>	
 
<br/> 
<b>Miscellaneous</b> <br/>
